# Diogenes: A troll? A Philosopher?

We've all seen or heard of someone so unconventional that they leave a lasting impression on us.
For me, **Diogenes of Sinope** is that someone. How could someone living in **400 BC** affect our thinking to such a degree?

In this article I would like to state **3 notable incidents** which give us a perspective into who diogenes really was?

---

The first incident occurred when **Alexander the great came to visit diogenes**, standing between diogenes and the sunlight, Alexander the great asked **"Is there anything I could do for you?"**
Diogenes replied - **"Yes, you could move out of the way, you are blocking my sunlight."**

The second incident occured when **Plato was conducting lectures** in his school.
Plato was asked how would he describe a man in few words. He described man as a **Featherless biped** - no feathers and walks on 2 legs, and in comes diogenes holding a chicken with all its feathers plucked screaming **"Behold Plato's Man!"**.

---
The third incident occured when Diogenes saw a boy drinking water from a stream by cupping his hands. Diogenes who owned only one bowl, said **"What a fool I am to carry such a superfluous baggage!"**, and **tossed the bowl away**.

These incidents show us that diogenes was a man with principles, humour, analytical thinking and a learning attitude. We don't really need to start living in a barrel to incorporate these qualities in our day-to-day life.
Who would have thought a man living in a barrel in 400 BC still influence our lives today.
